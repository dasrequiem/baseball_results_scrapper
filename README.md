# baseball_results_scrapper
Python script that uses Selenium to gather download links for pdf result files in the Fedebeis website for Panama baseball league results.

**Objective:**
To download all the results by the Panamanian fedebeis (baseball federation) for a given year in one competition.
The results are posted in pdf files that can be downloaded manually so this script uses Selenium and the chrome driver to download over 170 pdf files
for the 2020 minor league results. I used the minor league because it was completed in 2020 but the major could not be finished because of the pandemic.
